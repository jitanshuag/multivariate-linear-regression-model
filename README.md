This project focuses on analyzing price elasticity of demand using real-world sales and pricing data. A multivariate log–log regression model was built in R to estimate how changes in product price affect quantity sold across different product categories. Additional factors such as freight cost, weekends, holidays, and product segments were included to make the analysis more realistic. Model assumptions were tested for multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity, and robust standard errors were used to ensure reliable inference. The results were visualized using coefficient plots with confidence intervals to clearly interpret the impact of price and other variables on demand.
